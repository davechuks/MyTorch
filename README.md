# MyTorch

This repository contains my solutions to the series of homework assignments for the Carnegie Mellon University course [11-785: Introduction to Deep Learning (Spring 2022)](https://deeplearning.cs.cmu.edu/S22/index.html). Each homework assignment consists of two parts:

1. **Autolab Software Engineering Component:** In this part, I will engineer my own deep learning library by implementing important deep learning algorithms and optimization methods from scratch.

2. **Kaggle Data Science Component:** In the second part, I will work on projects related to real world AI topics such as speech recognition, face recognition, machine translation, among others.
